# QWEN.md

This file provides guidance to Qwen Code when working with code in this
repository. Qwen Code's context loader reads exactly `QWEN.md` and `AGENTS.md`
in a directory; this repo deliberately ships only `QWEN.md` — there is no
`AGENTS.md` here (each harness gets its own file; see "Prompt files by
harness" below), so this file is the sole source of project guidance for a
Qwen Code session.

## What this project is

`culture-agent-template` is a **clonable template for AgentCulture mesh agents**.
It is a working, minimal example of the sibling pattern every Culture agent
follows: an agent-first CLI, a mesh identity, the canonical skill kit, and a
buildable/deployable package baseline. Clone it, rename the package, edit
`culture.yaml`, and you have a new agent that `steward doctor` recognizes.

It is a sibling to [`guildmaster`](https://github.com/agentculture/guildmaster)
(the **skills supplier**), [`steward`](https://github.com/agentculture/steward)
(**alignment** — `steward doctor`, the sibling-pattern baseline), and
[`teken`](https://github.com/agentculture/teken) (the **afi-cli** "Agent First
Interface" scaffolder this CLI is cited from) within the Organic Development
framework.

## Prompt files by harness

This repo's root carries one prompt file per agent harness, each read by
exactly one of them — there is no shared base file for them to inherit from:

- **Claude Code** → [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (the fullest write-up; read it
  first if you are new to the repo).
- **Pi / associate** → [`AGENTS.override.md`](AGENTS.override.md) for context,
  plus [`.pi/SYSTEM.md`](.pi/SYSTEM.md) for its system prompt.
- **colleague** → [`AGENTS.colleague.md`](AGENTS.colleague.md).
- **Qwen Code** → this file.

## Identity

Declared in `culture.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
- suffix: culture-agent-template
  backend: claude
```

`backend: claude` fixes the *mesh resident* prompt file to `CLAUDE.md` — the
mesh runtime reads that file, not this one. A Qwen Code session working in a
clone of this repo is a separate, local tool session; it reads `QWEN.md`
regardless of what `culture.yaml` declares, and running Qwen Code here neither
requires nor changes that declaration. The declaration and the resident prompt
together satisfy the two invariants `steward doctor` verifies:
**prompt-file-present** and **backend-consistency** (`claude` ↔ `CLAUDE.md`).

## Cloning this template (re-initialization)

When you start a new agent from this template:

1. Rename the package directory `culture_agent_template/` → `<your_module>/`
   and replace `culture_agent_template` (module) / `culture-agent-template`
   (CLI and dist name) throughout `pyproject.toml`, the package, `tests/`,
   `sonar-project.properties`, and `README.md`. The name is hard-coded in
   ~100 places, so list every occurrence first rather than renaming by hand
   (`git grep` is portable and skips `.git` / untracked `__pycache__`):

   ```bash
   git grep -nF -e 'culture-agent-template' -e 'culture_agent_template'
   ```

2. Set your `suffix` (and `backend`) in `culture.yaml`. `whoami` and `doctor`
   then reflect the new identity with no further code change.
3. Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` (and this file, and the other two harness files) to
   describe your agent.
4. Re-vendor the skill kit you need from guildmaster (see
   `docs/skill-sources.md`) — keep only the skills your agent uses.

## The CLI

The CLI is cited (cite-don't-import) from teken's `python-cli` reference
(`teken cli cite`), so the runtime package has **no third-party dependencies**;
`teken` (a.k.a. `afi-cli`) is a dev dependency only. Agent-first verbs:

- `culture-agent-template whoami` — identity from `culture.yaml`.
- `culture-agent-template learn` — structured self-teaching prompt.
- `culture-agent-template explain <path>` — markdown docs for any noun/verb.
- `culture-agent-template overview` — descriptive snapshot of the agent.
- `culture-agent-template doctor` — check the agent-identity invariants.
- `culture-agent-template cli overview` — describe the CLI surface itself.

Conventions: every command supports `--json`; results go to stdout, errors and
diagnostics to stderr (never mixed); exit codes are `0` success, `1` user
error, `2` environment error, `3+` reserved. The agent-first rubric is
enforced in CI by `teken cli doctor . --strict`.

## Skills

`.claude/skills/` vendors the **canonical guildmaster skill kit**
(cite-don't-import). Provenance and the re-sync procedure live in
`docs/skill-sources.md`. Do not reformat or edit vendored scripts — re-sync
from guildmaster instead.

## Conventions

- **Every PR bumps the version** — even docs/config/CI. Use the
  `version-bump` skill; the `version-check` CI job blocks merge otherwise.
- **Tests**: `uv run pytest -n auto`. **Lint**: black, isort, flake8 (line
  length 100), bandit, markdownlint.
- **Deploy**: pushing to `main` publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing
  (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`); PRs do a TestPyPI dry-run.

This file describes the repository **as it exists on disk today**. When you
edit, keep claims grounded in checked-in reality; if a section drifts ahead of
reality, mark it `(planned)` or move it under a `## Roadmap` heading. For the
full set of workflow conventions (worktree layout, memory discipline,
`ask-colleague` usage), see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — those conventions apply
to work in this repo regardless of which harness is doing it.
