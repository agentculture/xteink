## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Four agent harnesses, each reading exactly one root file.** Claude
  Code→`CLAUDE.md`; Pi/`associate`→`AGENTS.override.md` (context) plus
  `.pi/SYSTEM.md` (system prompt, which *replaces* Pi's default);
  colleague→`AGENTS.colleague.md`; Qwen Code→`QWEN.md`. Deliberately **no**
  `AGENTS.md` — `AGENTS.override.md` is what stops Pi inheriting `CLAUDE.md`.
- One skill tree, four loaders: `.qwen/skills`, `.colleague/skills` and
  `.pi/skills` are relative symlinks onto `.claude/skills`. No forked scripts,
  no duplicated docs.
- `docs/harness-selection.md` (the two selections), plus
  `docs/automation-contract.md` and `docs/harness-invocations.yaml` (the four
  forced invocations as a machine-readable contract), and
  `docs/harness-verification.md` (the instrumented run).
- `scripts/harness-smoke.py` — a per-harness CI check that fails when **any one**
  of the four configs is broken, so three-quarters of a clone cannot rot
  unnoticed. A skipped check is reported as not-verified, never as a pass.
- `scripts/scan-secrets.py` — CI gate against committed credentials and
  non-localhost endpoints, with planted-secret tests proving it catches.

### Changed

- `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`. Because no code path rewrites that
  key, the template's declaration is what every clone inherits — the previous
  `colleague` value is why ~30 siblings carry a backend disagreeing with their
  seeded prompt file.
- `backend-fingerprints.yaml` re-synced from steward: list-valued prompts, so
  `acp` accepts `QWEN.md` and `colleague` accepts `AGENTS.override.md` and
  `.pi/SYSTEM.md`.

### Fixed

- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `QWEN.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`,
  `AGENTS.colleague.md` and `docs/skill-sources.md` had claimed this repo was a
  colleague resident, contradicting `culture.yaml`. Every harness prompt now
  names `backend: claude` / `CLAUDE.md` as the mesh resident, while stating
  that its own harness stays interactively available regardless.
- `.pi/settings.json`'s `skills` key is **inert** — that key belongs to a
  `package.json` manifest, not `settings.json`. Syscall instrumentation on a
  fresh clone: settings alone opened **0** `SKILL.md`; the `.pi/skills` symlink
  opened **19**. Replaced with the symlink, settings file removed.
- `doctor` no longer accepts an interactive harness's prompt file as the mesh
  resident's. Four harnesses ride three backend names, so `AGENTS.override.md`,
  `.pi/SYSTEM.md` and `QWEN.md` are *recognized* under `colleague`/`acp` — but
  the Culture daemon reads exactly one file per backend, and a clone carrying
  only Pi's files under `backend: colleague` used to report healthy with no
  resident prompt at all. `prompt_file_present` now requires the resident
  prompt; the others are reported by a new `harness_prompts` info check.
- `scan-secrets.py` closes three evasions: values containing `@`/`:`/`%`/`=`/`?`
  are now matched in full instead of stopping at a base64-ish alphabet (a
  quoted JSON key is matched too, which it never was); the placeholder
  exemption is a whole-value judgement, so a high-entropy literal merely
  *containing* `fake`/`example` is still reported; and endpoint hosts are
  parsed with `urlsplit`, so a bracketed IPv6 authority such as
  `http://[2001:db8::1]:8080` can no longer slip past the localhost allowlist.
- `harness-smoke.py`: a live probe is satisfied by **stdout only** (stderr
  noise mentioning `yes` or a prompt filename no longer counts as an answer,
  and a yes/no probe must answer exactly `yes`); a nonzero exit from `steward
  doctor` or `guild create` can no longer reach a passing branch on
  success-shaped JSON; failure/skip/waiver diagnostics go to stderr, leaving
  stdout to results; and an unknown `--stage` exits 1 (user error) rather than
  argparse's 2 (reserved for environment failures).

Known gaps carried into this release (not a changelog category — recorded
here so the release is not read as claiming more than it delivers): colleague
loads **0 of 19** skills from the nested tree, blocked on two upstream defects
filed with a reproduction as
[`agentculture/colleague#494`](https://github.com/agentculture/colleague/issues/494)
(the template ships the correct shape regardless); and retrofitting
already-provisioned siblings is an explicit **non-goal**, so
`culture-agent-template#25` stays open for the existing fleet.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **`validate-delivery` skill** (origin `devague`, re-broadcast by
  `guildmaster`) — the validation leg between `/assign-to-workforce` and
  `/summarize-delivery`: run the confirmed plan's behavioral tests agent-side,
  then file obligations, evidence, and behavioral deltas. Record-only; the
  `devague` CLI never runs a test.
- **`scripts/` wrappers for the five prompt-only workflow skills** — `scope`,
  `challenge`, `deviate`, `validate-delivery`, `summarize-delivery`. Each
  forwards its arguments to the `devague` CLI verbatim, so upstream owns the
  surface. Every clone now ships a complete, convention-clean skill directory
  instead of inheriting the script-less shape.

### Changed

- **Re-synced all eight `devague`-origin workflow skills** — `scope`, `think`,
  `challenge`, `spec-to-plan`, `assign-to-workforce`, `deviate`,
  `validate-delivery`, `summarize-delivery` — from devague `0.24.1`
  (`ec15362`), matching guildmaster's canonical copies. Notable upstream
  content: `/scope` fans out to read-only exploration subagents at 5+ candidate
  surfaces, and `assign-to-workforce split-plan --write` persists a durable
  gate-2 record.
- **All eight `SKILL.md` files are now byte-verbatim with upstream.** devague
  ships `type: command` on all eight itself, so nothing is added to the
  frontmatter here. The only divergence is the five wrapper scripts, which are
  additions, not edits.
- **`docs/skill-sources.md` updated for the re-sync** — count corrected from
  seven skills to eight (`validate-delivery` had no row), all eight rows
  repointed to `../guildmaster/.claude/skills/`, and pins refreshed to devague
  `0.24.1`.
- **The 2026-07-15 "vendor directly from devague" divergence is superseded.**
  That decision existed to keep guildmaster's `scripts/*.sh` wrappers out of
  this repo. The wrappers are now wanted: without them a clone ships a
  `SKILL.md` with no sibling `scripts/` and fails a
  `test_skills_convention`-style gate (guildmaster#95). The old section is
  retained, marked superseded, with its stale re-sync recipe replaced — that
  recipe would have deleted the wrappers this release adds and skipped
  `validate-delivery` entirely.

### Fixed

- **`scope.sh` usage advertised an invalid claim kind** — `--kind non-goal`
  (hyphen) is rejected by `devague capture`, which accepts `non_goal`. Anyone
  copying the wrapper's usage line got `invalid choice: 'non-goal'`. Corrected
  in both this repo and guildmaster.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **`resume <task-id|last> [--detach]` verb** in `ask-colleague` — pick a cut / timed-out / SIGTERM'd run back up from its persisted artifact, continuing on the original `colleague/<id>` work branch.
- **Per-seat thinking effort** in `ask-colleague` — `--effort` (acting seat), `--seat-effort S=R` (any seat), `--role NAME` (colleague#416). Rule of thumb: `--effort off` for small well-specified briefs, default for ordinary work, `xhigh` for open-ended judgement.
- **Review diff front-loading** — `ask-colleague review` embeds a filtered, bounded diff directly in the prompt instead of relying on the colleague run to fetch it.

### Changed

- **`ask-colleague` re-vendored byte-verbatim from `agentculture/colleague` @ 1.63.0** (cite-don't-import) — all five files (`SKILL.md`, `scripts/ask-colleague.sh`, `prompts/{explore,review,write}.md`). Every repo scaffolded from this template (`guild create` instantiates it) shipped the Qwen3.6-era wrapper until now.
- **Default colleague model is `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4`** (was the Qwen3.6 pin). The lobes gateway on `:8001` no longer serves 3.6, so the previous default only worked via colleague's auto-refresh warning path.
- **`docs/skill-sources.md` ledger row** for `ask-colleague` updated to the 1.63.0 sync (was `2026-06-12 (colleague 1.7.0, direct)`) and its verb list extended with `plan` / `resume` / the pilot verbs.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Worktree location convention** in `CLAUDE.md` — every worktree you create
  by hand (workforce fan-out lanes, scratch checkouts) lives in
  `../.worktrees.culture-agent-template/<name>/`, one
  repo-named directory beside the checkout, replacing a shared `../worktrees/`
  folder. This workspace holds many sibling projects, so a generic shared
  folder accumulates orphaned trees from several repos at once with nothing
  indicating ownership — a stale-tree sweep can't tell a live lane from junk.
  Matches the convention already documented in sibling repo `reachy-mini-cli`.
  Adds branch-prefix guidance (scope the prefix to the work; plain `agent/*`
  collides with leftovers from earlier fan-outs and fails `git worktree add
  -b`), and notes that the vendored `assign-to-workforce` skill uses both the
  shared path *and* `agent/<task-id>` branches in its fan-out example — it is
  cited verbatim and must not be edited, so both are overridden when following
  it. Teardown guidance names `git worktree remove <path>` as the verb that
  actually deletes a worktree; `git worktree prune` only clears metadata for
  directories that are already gone. Tool-managed throwaways are explicitly
  out of scope: `ask-colleague`'s read-only verbs create a detached worktree
  under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` and reap it on an EXIT trap, so they never persist
  to need an owner.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Four devague-origin skills re-vendored into `.claude/skills/`**
  (cite-don't-import), synced to the fixed devague source
  (devague#74/#75/#76):
  - `challenge` — a risk-scaled blind-spot discovery pass that runs between
    `/think` and `/spec-to-plan`, routing findings back through the existing
    deterministic moves as human-adjudicated proposals.
  - `scope` — the idea→scope leg that surveys the surfaces an idea touches
    before framing, seeding the Announcement Frame with provenance-backed
    boundary/non-goal/assumption claims.
  - `deviate` — stops an in-flight `assign-to-workforce` run when execution
    must diverge from the confirmed plan and records the divergence as a
    first-class, append-only deviation record.
  - `summarize-delivery` — closes the loop after an `assign-to-workforce`
    run with a planned-vs-actual accountability artifact.

  These four originate in `devague` and are re-broadcast via guildmaster; see
  `docs/skill-sources.md` for provenance.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Memory-discipline "Conventions and workflow" section in `CLAUDE.md`** — a
  per-task *recall-before / remember-after* convention (scope localized to this
  repo's nick) so the vendored `remember` / `recall` skills are actually used,
  not just present: `/recall` before non-trivial work to build on prior
  decisions instead of re-deriving them, and `/remember` when a non-obvious
  decision, constraint, fix-and-why, or hard-won gotcha surfaces. The section
  documents this repo's memory as **in-repo and public** — records resolve to
  `<repo-root>/.eidetic/memory` (committed, team- and mesh-shared). Inserted
  idempotently (skipped if already present), slotted under an existing
  "Conventions and workflow" heading when one exists, else appended.

### Changed

- **Refreshed the `remember` + `recall` wrappers from eidetic-cli 0.10.0**
  (cite-don't-import) — picks up eidetic's **project-local store default**: the
  files backend now resolves per record by visibility — PUBLIC records inside a
  git repo go to `<repo-root>/.eidetic/memory` (committed, team-shared), PRIVATE
  records (or any record outside a repo) go to `$HOME/.eidetic/memory` (never
  committed), an explicit `EIDETIC_DATA_DIR` still wins, and recall reads both
  stores and merges. Also carries the 0.9.3 hardening (interactive-stdin guard,
  `help` as a search term, SIGPIPE-safe suffix parsing). **Recipe policy
  override (the wrappers here are NOT byte-verbatim):** the injected default
  visibility is flipped from eidetic's `private` to **`public`**, so a plain
  `/remember` lands the note in `./.eidetic/memory` in this repo, kept as part
  of the repo — pass `--visibility private` to route a record to `$HOME`
  instead. `remember` drives `eidetic remember` (idempotent upsert of one JSON
  record or an NDJSON batch on stdin); `recall` drives `eidetic recall` with
  four search modes (exact / approximate / keyword / hybrid). Each `SKILL.md` is
  localized only in the illustrative `--scope <nick>` examples (Provenance keeps
  "First-party to eidetic-cli"). Runtime dep: the `eidetic` CLI on PATH (else a
  local eidetic-cli checkout with `uv`) — **`eidetic >= 0.10.0`** for the
  in-repo routing; on an older CLI the public records still work but are stored
  in `$HOME/.eidetic/memory` instead of in-repo. Propagated by rollout-cli's
  `eidetic-memory` recipe.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Vendored the `remember` + `recall` memory skills from eidetic-cli**
  (cite-don't-import) — the write/read halves of eidetic's shared
  `$HOME/.eidetic/memory` surface, so this agent (Claude and its colleague
  backend) can persist facts across sessions and recall them later, sharing
  one store.
  `remember` drives `eidetic remember` (idempotent upsert of one JSON record or
  an NDJSON batch on stdin, dedup by id + content hash); `recall` drives
  `eidetic recall` with four search modes — exact / approximate / keyword /
  hybrid — each hit carrying text, full provenance metadata, a relevance score,
  and a freshness signal. The `.sh` wrappers are byte-verbatim from eidetic-cli
  (their first-party origin); each `SKILL.md` is localized only in the
  illustrative `--scope <nick>` examples (Provenance keeps "First-party to
  eidetic-cli"). Both default to this agent's PRIVATE scope, reading the suffix
  from `culture.yaml`. Runtime dep: the `eidetic` CLI on PATH (else a local
  eidetic-cli checkout with `uv`). Propagated by rollout-cli's `eidetic-memory`
  recipe.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Identity docs and self-description strings still claimed `backend: claude`
  (prompt file `CLAUDE.md`), but this template was promoted to a colleague
  resident in #14/#15: `culture.yaml` declares `backend: colleague` (Qwen) with
  `AGENTS.colleague.md` as the resident prompt. Corrected the stale claim in
  `CLAUDE.md` (Identity section), `README.md`, `docs/skill-sources.md`, and the
  two CLI description strings (`overview` artifacts and `explain doctor`). The
  `doctor` backend→prompt-file mapping and the tests were already on
  `colleague`; this aligns the prose and self-description with them.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- pyproject.toml: correct the `license` field and PyPI classifier from MIT to
  Apache-2.0 to match the `LICENSE` file. The README License section was already
  corrected in 0.3.2, but the package metadata was missed; the built wheel now
  reports `License-Expression: Apache-2.0`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- ask-colleague skill: `monitor`/`guide`/`stop` pilot verbs plus a `--watch`
  flag to dispatch, watch the live feed of, send mid-flight guidance to, and
  cooperatively stop a running colleague flight (re-vendored from colleague).

### Changed

- README: correct the License section from MIT to Apache 2.0 to match the
  `LICENSE` file.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- CLAUDE.md: add a convention to reach for the `ask-colleague` skill reflexively
  for explore/review/write/grade — read-only `review`/`explore` are always safe;
  side-effecting `write` needs the user's go-ahead.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- AGENTS.colleague.md resident prompt file (backend colleague <-> AGENTS.colleague.md)

### Changed

- Promote agent identity to a colleague resident: culture.yaml backend
  claude -> colleague with a pinned model. The `doctor` backend-consistency
  map gains `colleague` -> AGENTS.colleague.md.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **Re-vendored the `ask-colleague` skill from colleague (now 1.7.0, up from the
  0.39.2 sync)** — the wrapper had drifted multiple releases behind origin. Picks
  up the `clean` verb (reap stale/corrupt `colleague/*` branches + orphaned
  `.colleague/` artifacts a crashed run left behind), the `--json` flag on every
  verb (result JSON on stdout, diagnostics/digest on stderr), the
  `_colleague_via_uv` local-dev resolution that honors `--repo`, and the
  tri-state (0/1/2) exit-code contract. `scripts/ask-colleague.sh` + `prompts/`
  are byte-identical to the origin; `SKILL.md` diverges only in the one
  consumer-identifying Provenance clause (`culture-agent-template vendors from
  guildmaster`). `docs/skill-sources.md` sync row updated to
  `2026-06-12 (colleague 1.7.0, direct)`. Refs: colleague#183, #186.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **`ask-colleague` skill** (`.claude/skills/ask-colleague/`) — the first-party front door to the `colleague` CLI (the renamed `convertible`). On top of `explore` / `review` / `write` it adds a `feedback` verb (grade a finished work item — the ROI loop), and `write` now **previews by default** in a throwaway worktree (no side effects) unless `--apply` / `--pr` is given. Reach for it reflexively — `review` for a diverse second opinion on a committed diff before opening a PR, `explore` for a fresh read of an unfamiliar area.

### Changed

- **Replaced the `outsource` skill with `ask-colleague`.** `outsource` was renamed to `ask-colleague` upstream ([colleague#148](https://github.com/agentculture/colleague/pull/148)). Because guildmaster has not re-broadcast the rename yet (its kit still ships the old `outsource`), `ask-colleague` is vendored **directly from the sibling `colleague` checkout** rather than from guildmaster — a tracked local divergence recorded in `docs/skill-sources.md`, parallel to the `agex` → `devex` one. Vendored verbatim except one consumer-identifying clause in the Provenance paragraph.
- **Ledger + CLAUDE.md + `.gitignore`:** point `docs/skill-sources.md` and the CLAUDE.md Skills section at `colleague` / `ask-colleague`, swap the *optional* runtime prerequisite `convertible` → `colleague` (env prefix `CONVERTIBLE_*` → `COLLEAGUE_*`, with the legacy names kept as a deprecated fallback), and gitignore the `.colleague/` run-artifact dir the skill writes (plus the stale `.agex/`).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Vendor the `outsource` skill** (`.claude/skills/outsource/`) from
  guildmaster's canonical copy (origin
  [`agentculture/convertible`](https://github.com/agentculture/convertible),
  re-broadcast via guildmaster — guildmaster
  [#51](https://github.com/agentculture/guildmaster/pull/51)). Every agent
  cloned from this template now inherits the ability to hand a scoped task to a
  *different* engine/mind: `explore` (read-only investigation), `review` (a
  diverse second opinion on the committed diff), and `write` (delegate a small
  implementation). `explore`/`review` run isolated in a throwaway `git worktree`;
  `write` refuses a dirty tree. Fulfils
  [#8](https://github.com/agentculture/culture-agent-template/issues/8).
- **Ledger + CLAUDE.md:** record `outsource` in `docs/skill-sources.md`
  (origin = convertible, re-broadcast via guildmaster; vendored verbatim — it
  already carries `type: command`) and document its *optional* runtime
  dependency on the `convertible` CLI (the skill exits with an install hint if
  absent, so a clone that never uses it is unaffected).

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Expanded the clone-and-rename instructions in `CLAUDE.md`: added `README.md` to
  the rename targets and a portable `git grep` discovery command so a cloner can
  find every occurrence of the template name (hard-coded in ~100 places across the
  package, including the CLI command files and `_ISSUES_URL` in
  `culture_agent_template/cli/__init__.py`) rather than renaming by hand.
- Synced `README.md`'s "Make it your own" checklist with `CLAUDE.md`: it now lists
  `README.md` itself as a rename target and points to `CLAUDE.md`'s discovery
  command as the authoritative procedure, so the two onboarding checklists no
  longer drift.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Renamed the PR-lifecycle CLI references `agex` / `agex-cli` to `devex` (same
  tool, new name) across `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/skill-sources.md`, `.gitignore`, and
  the vendored `cicd`, `assign-to-workforce`, and `communicate` skills — the
  `cicd` scripts now invoke `devex pr`.
- Logged the vendored-skill in-place patch as a local divergence in
  `docs/skill-sources.md`; the matching canonical rename is tracked upstream for
  guildmaster in
  [agentculture/guildmaster#48](https://github.com/agentculture/guildmaster/issues/48)
  so a future re-sync reconciles cleanly.
- Aligned the documented `devex` version floor to `>=0.21` across the vendored
  `cicd` `SKILL.md` and `workflow.sh` install hint (were `>=0.1`), matching
  `docs/skill-sources.md` and the `await`-era feature set; flagged upstream on
  guildmaster#48.

### Fixed

- SonarCloud now reports code coverage — added `relative_files = true` to
  `[tool.coverage.run]` so `coverage.xml` emits repo-relative paths that map to
  `sonar.sources=culture_agent_template` (absolute / `.venv` paths were dropped
  as unmappable). Mirrors the sibling `convertible` setup.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- **CI gates on the SonarCloud quality gate**
  ([issue #3](https://github.com/agentculture/culture-agent-template/issues/3)) —
  added `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true` to `sonar-project.properties` so a failing
  gate fails the `test` job when `SONAR_TOKEN` is set. Token-less repos and fork
  PRs remain green (the scan step is guarded by `if: env.SONAR_TOKEN != ''`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Onboarded into the AgentCulture mesh** ([issue #1](https://github.com/agentculture/culture-agent-template/issues/1)).
- **Agent-first CLI** cited from teken's (`afi-cli`) `python-cli` reference
  (`teken cli cite`) — verbs `whoami`, `learn`, `explain`, `overview`, `doctor`,
  and the `cli` noun group. Runtime is self-contained (`dependencies = []`);
  `teken>=0.8` is a dev dependency only. Passes the seven-bundle agent-first
  rubric (`teken cli doctor . --strict`). `doctor` checks the agent-identity
  invariants (prompt-file-present, backend-consistency, skills-present).
- **Mesh identity**: `culture.yaml` (`suffix: culture-agent-template`,
  `backend: claude`) and the matching `CLAUDE.md` prompt file.
- **Canonical guildmaster skill kit** (11 skills) vendored under
  `.claude/skills/` (cite-don't-import): `agent-config`, `assign-to-workforce`,
  `cicd`, `communicate`, `doc-test-alignment`, `pypi-maintainer`, `run-tests`,
  `sonarclaude`, `spec-to-plan`, `think`, `version-bump`. Every `SKILL.md`
  carries `type: command` (load-bearing for the culture/claude backend);
  `cicd` / `communicate` consumer-identifying prose adapted, all script bodies
  verbatim. Provenance in `docs/skill-sources.md`. Three skills (`think`,
  `spec-to-plan`, `assign-to-workforce`) originate in `devague`, re-broadcast
  via guildmaster.
- **Build + deploy baseline**: `pyproject.toml` (hatchling), `tests/` (pytest,
  xdist, coverage), `.github/workflows/{tests,publish}.yml` (CI rubric/lint gate,
  PyPI Trusted Publishing), `.flake8`, `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`,
  `sonar-project.properties`, and `.claude/skills.local.yaml.example`.
