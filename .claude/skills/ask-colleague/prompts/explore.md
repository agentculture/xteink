$ARGUMENTS

Rules:
- This is READ-ONLY. Use read_file, list_dir, and read-only run_command only
  (e.g. `git log`, `git grep`, `ls`, `rg`). Do NOT create, modify, or delete any
  file, and do NOT run any command that changes state.
- Be concrete: cite file paths and line numbers; quote the key code you rely on.
- Surface what's surprising, risky, or unclear — not just a tidy summary.
- Search efficiently: don't repeat near-identical searches — once a search
  points you at the relevant file, READ it instead of re-grepping for synonyms.
- You have a limited step budget, and a report that never calls `finish` returns
  NOTHING — wasting the whole drive. The moment you have enough to write a useful
  report (or you are within a few steps of the budget), STOP reading and call
  `finish`. Err on the side of finishing early — a focused finding beats endless
  reading.
- For a WIDE codebase map (many folders/modules), do NOT read every file in series
  — that exhausts the step budget. Partition the surface by folder and delegate the
  per-folder sub-surveys to the `subagents` tool (one child per folder/subtree, each
  returning its findings), then synthesize their results into your report.
- NARRATE PROGRESS: with EVERY tool call, write one short line of plain text
  first — what you just learned and what you are checking next. That line rides
  the run's flight feed, so the operator can see where you are instead of a
  silent turn. A long think with nothing written looks like a stall. If you are
  within ~3 steps of the budget, STOP and write the answer-so-far (partial is
  fine, mark it partial) rather than reading one more file.

When you are done, call finish with a structured findings report:
1. What it is / how it works (with file:line references).
2. Notable details, edge cases, or surprises.
3. Open questions or risks worth a closer look.
