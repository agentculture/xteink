# ask-colleague — hand a scoped repo task to colleague (a different engine/mind).
#
# Colleague's engine is not necessarily stronger than the calling agent; it is
# a *different* mind, and diversity helps — which is why `review` is the headline
# verb. Three verbs drive `colleague drive` and print the result:
#
#   ask-colleague explore "<question or area>"   read-only investigation -> findings
#   ask-colleague review  "<what to focus on>"   diverse second-opinion on the diff
#   ask-colleague write   "<task>" [--apply]     implement a change (preview by default)
#   ask-colleague feedback <id|last> --rating N  grade a past drive (ROI loop); no rating -> show
#   ask-colleague feedback list                  list every recorded drive by request + grade
#   ask-colleague clean                          reap stale colleague/* branches + artifacts (#162)
#
# explore/review run in a throwaway `git worktree` at HEAD, so they can never
# touch your working tree or branch (any stray write is discarded). write also
# previews in a throwaway worktree by default (reporting what it WOULD change);
# pass --apply to land a drive branch in place, or --pr to push + open a PR.
#
# explore/review are read-only probes: they preserve their artifact but do NOT
# move the `last` pointer (issue #132), so `feedback last` stays aimed at the
# most recent consequential write. Grade a probe by its printed task-id (every
# drive prints `task:` and a `grade:` hint), or find it with `feedback list`.
#
# A crashed/interrupted `write --apply` can leave a dangling colleague/<id>
# branch (and 0-byte .colleague/ artifacts) that breaks `git fetch`. The
# EXIT-trap cleanup below only reaps the *current* read-only run's worktree, not
# a *prior* crashed run — `ask-colleague clean` (which shells out to `colleague
# clean`) reaps those, scoped strictly to colleague/* so an unrelated branch is
# never touched.
#
# Exit-code policy (matches colleague's CLI contract, #161): 0 success · 1
# user-input error (bad/missing verb, flag, arg, or path; dirty-tree state guard
# — same class as the runtime's EXIT_USER_ERROR guard) · 2 environment/setup
# error (missing required tool, colleague CLI not found, missing prompt template).

Usage:
  ask-colleague explore "<question or area>"     Read-only investigation -> findings (no side effects)
  ask-colleague review  "<what to focus on>"     Diverse second-opinion on the committed diff (no side effects)
  ask-colleague write   "<task>" [--apply|--pr]  Implement a change (preview by default; --apply lands it)
  ask-colleague plan    "<task>" [--no-workforce] Colleague PLANS a complex task (spec -> plan -> subagent workforce)
  ask-colleague feedback <id|last> [--rating N]  Grade a past drive (ROI loop); with --rating records, without shows
  ask-colleague feedback list                    List every recorded drive by request + grade (find one by its request)
  ask-colleague clean [--dry-run]                Reap stale/corrupt colleague/* branches + orphaned .colleague/ artifacts (#162)
  ask-colleague monitor <task-id>                Stream a running flight's live feed (--follow)
  ask-colleague guide   <task-id> "<msg>"         Send mid-flight guidance to a running flight
  ask-colleague stop    <task-id>                Ask a running flight to stop (cooperative)
  ask-colleague resume  <task-id|last> [--detach] Resume a cut/timed-out/SIGTERM'd run from its artifact (work --continue)

Options:
  --repo PATH        Target repo (default: .)
  --dry-run          (clean) report what would be reaped without changing anything
  --base BRANCH      Base for `review` diff (default: main)
  --engine NAME      Backend plugin (default: $COLLEAGUE_ENGINE or vllm-openai)
  --model NAME       Model (default: $COLLEAGUE_MODEL or unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4)
  --role NAME        Typed subagent role (e.g. explorer, reviewer, writer); a top-level
                     explorer runs at thinking effort "low" by default (#416)
  --effort RUNG      Thinking effort for the ACTING seat: off|low|medium|high|xhigh|default
                     (#416; default = colleague's table, medium for the acting seat;
                     "default" = the kill-switch, send nothing). Exported as
                     COLLEAGUE_CORTEX_REASONING_EFFORT + COLLEAGUE_WORKER_REASONING_EFFORT.
  --seat-effort S=R  Per-seat override, comma-separated (seats: cortex, worker, deepthink,
                     senses, evaluator, design), e.g. --seat-effort senses=off,deepthink=xhigh
  --detach           (resume) run detached (setsid/nohup) and return at once; pilot it with
                     monitor/guide/stop once the new flight id appears in the log
  --base-url URL     OpenAI base URL (default: $COLLEAGUE_BASE_URL or http://localhost:8001/v1)
  --max-steps N      Loop step budget (default: 20; explore/review default from
                     colleague's own "explore"/"review" mode profile, today 30 —
                     an explicit --max-steps always overrides, lower or higher)
  --timeout N        Per-request timeout, seconds (default: $COLLEAGUE_TIMEOUT or 300)
  --no-workforce     (plan) deliver the spec+plan only, skip the workforce fan-out (#215)
  --quick / --no-spec (plan) skip the spec stage, plan directly from the request (#199)
  --apply            (write) apply the change in place (drive branch) instead of previewing
  --allow-dirty      (write) allow running on a dirty tree (only with --apply/--pr)
  --pr               (write) push + open a PR instead of a local drive branch (implies --apply)
  --rating N         (feedback) record a 1-5 quality rating for the drive
  --notes "..."      (feedback) free-text notes to store with the rating
  --by NAME          (feedback) who is grading (default: colleague's resolved identity)
  --watch            (explore/review/write) arm a flight so you can monitor/guide/stop it
  --json             Machine-readable output: stdout carries only the result JSON,
                     every diagnostic/digest line goes to stderr (any verb)

explore/review run in a throwaway git worktree at HEAD — they cannot touch your
working tree or branch. review compares <base>...HEAD (committed changes only).
write previews in a throwaway worktree too unless --apply (or --pr) is given.
feedback grades a finished drive: stats (in the artifact) say what it cost,
feedback says how good it was — together, the ROI of outsourcing. explore/review
do not move `last` (they are read-only) — grade them by their printed task-id, or
run `ask-colleague feedback list` to find a drive by its request.
clean recovers a repo a crashed run wedged: it reaps stale/corrupt colleague/*
branches + orphaned .colleague/ artifacts (scoped to colleague/* only). For the
full flag set (--merged / --older-than) call `colleague clean` directly.

# ── explore/review adopt colleague's native mode profile (t4/spec R1) ───────
# explore/review's step budget + synthesis-reserve tail used to be caller-side
# overrides baked into this script (a fixed --max-steps 30 plus an exported
# COLLEAGUE_SYNTHESIS_RESERVE_STEPS=3). Those numbers now live in colleague's
# own mode-profile catalog (colleague/profiles.py "explore"/"review") and are
# applied runtime-side by `colleague work --mode explore|review`
# (colleague/config.py apply_mode_profile) — so this wrapper's job shrinks to
# "select the mode" instead of re-deriving the profile's numbers itself; a
# future retune of the profile then reaches this wrapper for free.
#
# Honest limit: this wrapper prefers an installed `colleague` on PATH ahead of
# a local checkout, and an installed CLI can be older than the one this repo
# ships (it can predate --mode entirely). Detect that cheaply by checking the
# resolved CLI's OWN --help text for the literal flag with a plain bash
# substring match (no external text-search tool — the resolver stays as
# dependency-free as the uv-fallback path above, #190); fall back to the old
# caller-side defaults when --mode isn't there, so the wrapper keeps working
# unmodified against a stale CLI.
#
# NOTE: the substring must be anchored past the flag name — "--mode" is
# itself a literal prefix of "--model" (already a flag on every version), so
# a naive `*--mode*` match false-positives on a stale --help that only has
# --model. Requiring the next character NOT be a letter (or end-of-string)
