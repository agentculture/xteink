  Ask colleague — a *different* backend/model than you (e.g. a local vLLM Qwen) —
  to take a scoped repo task off your plate, then fold its answer back. The point
  isn't a stronger model; it's a second, independent mind, and that diversity is
  the value: `ask-colleague review` gets a candid second opinion on a diff,
  `ask-colleague explore` gets a fresh read of an area, `ask-colleague write`
  hands off a small implementation, `ask-colleague feedback` grades a finished
  work item (the ROI loop), and `ask-colleague clean` reaps stale/corrupt
  `colleague/*` branches a crashed run left behind (which can break `git fetch`).
  Pilot a running work item with `monitor`/`guide`/`stop`.
  Reach for it REFLEXIVELY, the way you'd lean over to the
  teammate at the next desk — not only when asked: before you present or open a PR
  on a non-trivial committed diff, run `review` for a diverse second opinion; for a
  fresh read of an unfamiliar area whose answer is independent of your current
  context, run `explore`. Both are read-only — isolated in a throwaway git
  worktree, zero side effects to your tree/branch — so the reflex is always safe; the
  side-effecting `write --apply` / `write --pr` still needs the user's go-ahead. Triggers when the
  user says "ask colleague", "ask a colleague to review/explore/write this", "have
  colleague take a look", "get a second opinion", "ask the other model", "rate that
  work item", "clean up a crashed colleague run" — and still on the legacy "outsource this".
  Colleague's output is a second opinion to verify and own, never authority.

# ask-colleague — lean on colleague as a different mind

`ask-colleague` drives the **`colleague`** CLI so a Claude agent can hand a scoped
task to a *different* backend (default: a local vLLM `Qwen3.8-27B` on
`:8001`). Colleague's model is **not** assumed to be stronger than you — its
value is **diversity**. A second, independent mind catches things the author's
mind glides past, which is why **review** is the headline verb. Treat it the way
you'd turn to the colleague at the next desk: a quick, low-ceremony ask, not a
heavyweight handoff.

This skill is the operator: a portable wrapper that resolves the CLI and turns
each verb into a `colleague work`, then prints the work item's result summary.

## The reflex — when to ask colleague *unprompted*

Don't wait to be told. The two read-only verbs have **zero side
effects** (throwaway worktree, can't touch your tree), so reaching for them is
always safe — make it a habit on tasks that fit:

**GO** (reach out on your own — default to the read-only verbs):

- **`review` — the standing reflex.** You (or a subagent) just produced a
  non-trivial *committed* diff and are about to present it or open a PR. Get a
  diverse second opinion *first*. A different mind catches what the author's mind
  glides past — that's the whole point. A real review on a local model takes tens
  of seconds to a few minutes (it reads the diff + touched files), so **kick it
  off in the background and keep working** rather than blocking on it; fold the
  findings in when it lands.
- **`explore`** — you need to understand an unfamiliar area whose answer is
  **independent of your current context**, and you could be doing something else
  meanwhile. Fan it out, fold the findings back.
- A scoped, **verifiable** subtask where a fresh pass raises your confidence and
  you can cheaply check the result.

**NO-GO** (just do it yourself):

- Work that needs *your* accumulated context, the user's intent, or cross-cutting
  design judgment — a context-free second mind will drift, not help.
- Anything **outward-facing or destructive** without a user nod: `write --apply` /
  `write --pr`, posting, deleting. The read-only verbs are the unprompted reflex;
  side-effecting ones are not.
- Trivial work that's faster to just do (a one-line edit) — the work item + fold-back
  costs more than the edit.
- Output you can't verify cheaply — if you can't check it, diversity is just noise.

**Guardrails (always):**

- **One-glance readiness.** `colleague whoami` names the live work engine +
  model; if it reports `mock` or you're unsure the server is up, run `colleague
  doctor --probe`. Don't burn time on a dead or no-op backend.
- **Second opinion, not authority.** colleague is a *different* mind, not a
  stronger one. Weigh its findings, verify its claims, own the decision. Diversity
  is the value; verification is the price.
- **Close the loop.** Occasionally `ask-colleague feedback last --rating N` so the
  ROI of asking colleague for this *kind* of task is measurable — and you learn
  when to stop.

## How to run

The entry point is `scripts/ask-colleague.sh`. Invoke it from the repo you want
colleague to work on:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/ask-colleague/scripts/ask-colleague.sh <verb> "<text>" [options]
```

It resolves the CLI portably — an installed `colleague` on `PATH` (the normal
case), falling back to `uv run colleague` when inside the colleague checkout,
else an install hint.

### Verbs

| Verb | What it does | Side effects |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `explore "<question or area>"` | Read-only investigation of the repo; the model reads and reports findings. | **None** to your working tree / branch — runs in a throwaway worktree at HEAD; writes only a gradable run artifact under the gitignored `.colleague/` bookkeeping dir. |
| `review "<what to focus on>" [--base main]` | A diverse second opinion on the **committed** diff (`<base>...HEAD`). | **None** to your working tree / branch — throwaway worktree, committed changes only; writes only a gradable run artifact under the gitignored `.colleague/` bookkeeping dir. |
| `write "<task>" [--apply\|--pr]` | Implement a change. **Previews by default** (throwaway worktree, prints the would-be diff); `--apply` lands a work branch in place; `--pr` pushes + opens a PR. | **None** to your working tree / branch by default (preview); a `colleague/<id>` work branch / PR only with `--apply` / `--pr`. |
| `plan "<task>"` | Colleague **PLANS** a complex task: it proposes a spec, then a split plan, then fans the waves out to a subagent-colleague workforce (`colleague plan run … --yes`). The *inverse of `/think`* — same arc, but colleague is the planning mind, not Claude. Needs a live backend. | Runs `colleague plan` in `--repo` (not a throwaway worktree): the workforce stage spawns isolated subagent worktrees and can land branches — treat like `write --apply` (gets a user nod). |
| `feedback <id\|last> [--rating N]` | **Grade a finished work item** (the ROI loop). With `--rating N` (1–5, plus `--notes`) it records feedback; without, it shows the work item's existing feedback. `last` resolves the most recent work item in `--repo`. | Writes `.colleague/<id>.feedback.json` only when `--rating` is given; read-only otherwise. |
| `resume <task-id\|last> [--detach]` | **Resume a cut run** — a timed-out / SIGTERM'd / budget-exhausted work item picked back up from its persisted artifact (`colleague work --continue`, lineage on `TaskResult.continued_from`). `last` resolves the most recent work item in `--repo`. `--detach` runs it under `setsid`/`nohup` and returns at once (not `--background`, which drops the continue id — colleague#418). | Continues the ORIGINAL run's `colleague/<id>` work branch; never touches your tree / branch. |
| `clean [--dry-run]` | **Reap what a crashed run left behind** (#162): stale/corrupt `colleague/*` branches + orphaned 0-byte `.colleague/` artifacts that can wedge `git fetch`. Scoped strictly to `colleague/*` (never touches an unrelated branch); conservative with `.git/objects` (reports 0-byte loose objects + suggests `git prune`, never deletes them). A thin pass-through to `colleague clean`. | Deletes corrupt `colleague/<id>` refs + 0-byte `.colleague/` artifacts in `--repo`; `--dry-run` changes nothing. |

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--repo PATH` | Target repo (default: `.`). |
| `--base BRANCH` | Base for the `review` diff (default: `main`). |
| `--engine NAME` | Backend plugin (default: `$COLLEAGUE_ENGINE` or `vllm-openai`). |
| `--model NAME` | Model (default: `$COLLEAGUE_MODEL` or `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4`). |
| `--base-url URL` | OpenAI base URL (default: `$COLLEAGUE_BASE_URL` or `http://localhost:8001/v1`). |
| `--role NAME` | Typed subagent role for the run (`explorer`, `reviewer`, `validator`, `planner`, `writer`). Since #416 a top-level `--role explorer` runs at thinking effort **`low`** (off selectable via `--effort off`); other top-level roles keep the acting seat's effort. |
| `--effort RUNG` | **Thinking effort for the acting seat** (#416): `off` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh` \| `default`. Unset = colleague's own table (acting seat `medium`). `off` sends `enable_thinking:false` — the measured win for small, well-specified briefs (same brief: off 24 s / xhigh 88 s / medium 129 s, all correct — `docs/evidence/2026-08-22-per-seat-thinking-effort-416-results.md`); `xhigh` for open-ended judgement; `default` = the kill-switch (send nothing, the pre-#416 wire). Exported as `COLLEAGUE_CORTEX_REASONING_EFFORT` + `COLLEAGUE_WORKER_REASONING_EFFORT`; validated before the run. |
| `--seat-effort S=R[,S=R]` | Per-seat override for the other seats (`cortex`, `worker`, `deepthink`, `senses`, `evaluator`, `design`) — e.g. `--seat-effort senses=off,deepthink=xhigh`. Exported as `COLLEAGUE_<SEAT>_REASONING_EFFORT`. Children keep their role table (writer/planner medium, reviewer/validator low, explorer off) unless the parent overrides per delegation. |
| `--detach` | (`resume`) run detached and return at once; pilot with `monitor` / `guide` / `stop` once the log names the new flight id. |
| `--max-steps N` | Loop step budget (default: 20). `explore`/`review` select colleague's own native **`explore`**/**`review`** mode profile (`colleague/profiles.py`, applied via `colleague work --mode`) instead of a wrapper-side override — today that profile defaults to 30, since read-only mapping fans out across more files. An explicit `--max-steps N` always overrides the profile's default, in either direction. If the resolved `colleague` predates `--mode` (a stale install on `PATH`), the wrapper falls back to the old caller-side `--max-steps 30` + reserved-steps behavior so it keeps working. |
| `--apply` | (`write`) apply the change in place (work branch) instead of previewing. |
| `--allow-dirty` | (`write`) allow running on a dirty tree (only matters with `--apply` / `--pr`). |
| `--pr` | (`write`) push + open a PR instead of a local work branch (implies `--apply`). |
| `--rating N` | (`feedback`) record a 1–5 quality rating for the work item. |
| `--notes "..."` | (`feedback`) free-text notes stored with the rating. |
| `--by NAME` | (`feedback`) who is grading (default: colleague's resolved identity). |
| `--dry-run` | (`clean`) report what would be reaped without changing anything. |
| `--json` | (any verb) machine-readable output: stdout carries **only** the result JSON, every diagnostic/digest line goes to stderr. |

The result printed to stdout is the work item's `TaskResult.summary` (plus
`changed_files` / work branch for `write`), parsed from `colleague work
--json`. Per-step progress streams to stderr while it runs. Pass `--json` to get
the raw `TaskResult` on stdout instead of the human digest (the drive verbs emit
the normalized `TaskResult`; `feedback` / `clean` forward `--json` to colleague),
keeping stdout valid JSON for a machine consumer while diagnostics stay on stderr.

## When to reach for which verb

- **review** — the standing use. You wrote (or an agent wrote) a change and you
  want a candid, independent pass over the *committed* diff before you trust it.
  Treat the output as a second opinion to weigh, not a verdict.
- **explore** — you want a fresh, unbiased read of an unfamiliar area ("how does
  X work here?") without anchoring on your own assumptions.
- **write** — a small, well-scoped implementation you're happy to delegate. It
  **previews by default** (runs in a throwaway worktree and prints the would-be
  diff without touching your tree); pass `--apply` to land it on a
  `colleague/<id>` work branch you can inspect, merge, or discard, or `--pr` to
  open a PR.
- **feedback** — *after* colleague finishes a work item, close the loop: record how
  good it was. Every work item's artifact already carries always-on **stats** (elapsed
  time, tokens read/generated, tools used, bytes written, reasoning-vs-answer
  sizes); `feedback` adds a 1–5 quality grade. Stats say what it *cost*, feedback
  says how *good* it was — together they let you compute the **ROI of asking
  colleague** and decide whether to ask again (and which backend). Grade the most
  recent work item with `ask-colleague feedback last --rating 4 --notes "…"`.
- **clean** — recovery, not routine. A crashed / interrupted `write --apply` can
  leave a dangling `colleague/<id>` branch pointing at half-written (0-byte)
  objects that **breaks `git fetch` / `git pull`**. Run `ask-colleague clean`
  (or `colleague clean`) to reap it — start with `--dry-run` to see what it would
  remove. It only ever touches `colleague/*` refs and `.colleague/` artifacts.

## Thinking effort and resuming (#416)

Colleague resolves a **per-seat thinking effort** where each seat is built,
never per turn — the acting seat defaults to `medium`, deepthink `xhigh`,
senses/Talker `off`, children by role (writer/planner `medium`,
reviewer/validator `low`, explorer `off`). The wrapper exposes the operator
overrides as `--effort` (acting seat) and `--seat-effort` (any seat); a typo
fails fast. Rule of thumb from the measurements: **`--effort off` for small,
well-specified briefs** (5× faster, same result), **leave the default for
ordinary work**, **`--effort xhigh` for open-ended judgement** (review of a
subtle diff, a plan). Effort does not rescue a module-sized brief — split the
request instead (#415).

A run cut by a timeout, SIGTERM or an exhausted budget is **resumable**:
`ask-colleague resume <task-id|last>` continues it from its artifact on the same
work branch; `--detach` keeps your shell free. Prefer resume over re-dispatch —
the continuation carries the prior steps and lineage.

## Piloting a flight

Dispatch a drive with `--watch` (on `explore`, `review`, or `write`) to make the
work item watchable. While it runs you can:

- **`ask-colleague monitor <task-id>`** — watch the flight's live feed
- **`ask-colleague guide <task-id> "<message>"`** — send mid-flight guidance
- **`ask-colleague stop <task-id>`** — cooperatively ask the flight to stop

Control is applied at the running loop's next turn boundary, so guidance and
stop requests take effect on the next iteration rather than interrupting mid-step.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

- **explore and review are read-only.** They run in a throwaway `git worktree`
  at HEAD, so a stray write can't reach your working tree or branch; the prompts
  also tell the model not to modify anything. Don't route a change-making task
  through them — use `write`.
- **`write` previews by default; applying refuses a dirty tree.** A preview runs
  in an isolated worktree and never touches your tree, so it is safe even when
  dirty. `--apply` / `--pr` (the in-place path) refuses a dirty tree unless you
  pass `--allow-dirty` — this guards the dirty-tree hazard: committing
  *uncommitted* edits onto the work branch and leaving you there. Commit or
  stash first before applying. `--allow-dirty` is propagated to the runtime,
  which since colleague#149 enforces the same guard directly (a bare
  `colleague work`/`drive` also refuses uncommitted *tracked* changes).
- **Colleague's output is a second opinion, not authority.** The backend may be a
  smaller/different model; weigh its findings, verify its claims, and own the
  decision yourself.

## Honest limits

- Read-only is enforced by **worktree isolation + prompt constraint**, not a
  sandbox — the loop always exposes `write_file`/`run_command`, so the model can
  still run arbitrary *read-only* commands.
- `review` covers **committed** changes only (`<base>...HEAD`). To review
  uncommitted work, commit it first.
- The default backend is whatever single model is running locally; a multi-model
  fleet (different model per verb) is separate infrastructure.
- **Every verb writes bookkeeping under `.colleague/`** (run artifacts for
  explore/review/write; feedback records; the `last_work` pointer) — none of it
  in your tracked tree, but in a repo that does **not** already gitignore
  `.colleague/` it shows up as untracked files. **Add `.colleague/` to your
  `.gitignore`** (keep `!/.colleague/commands/` if you commit command templates).
- **A crashed run can wedge `git fetch`.** A `write --apply` interrupted
  mid-commit can leave a dangling `colleague/<id>` branch + 0-byte artifacts;
  `ask-colleague clean` recovers it. A SIGKILL/OOM *during* the commit can still
  corrupt git objects (git/filesystem durability, not the skill's to guarantee)
  — which is exactly what `clean` is for.

## Provenance

This is a **first-party** colleague skill — colleague is its origin. See
`docs/skill-sources.md` for the consumer's per-repo skill ledger. The `cite,
don't import` policy holds: downstream repos copy it, they don't symlink or
depend on it.
