# spec-to-plan.sh — drive devague's spec→plan engine (the /spec-to-plan skill).
#
# The skill is named `spec-to-plan`; the product/CLI it drives is `devague` (the
# idea→spec half lives in the sibling /think skill). This wrapper forwards every
# move to `devague plan <move>` verbatim — including the `status` verb the CLI
# internalised in 0.11.0 (devague#30/#31), which reads the plan convergence gate
# and names the recommended next move. It is the forward leg: seed a plan from a
# *converged* frame, then work it into a buildable plan.
#
# Origin: authored and maintained in agentculture/devague. guildmaster pulls this
# skill from here and broadcasts it to the rest of the AgentCulture mesh, so it
# is written to run anywhere — portable bash, no devague-checkout assumptions.
#
# Plans persist under .devague/ in the current directory (alongside frames), so
# run from the repo you are speccing.

spec-to-plan.sh — drive devague's spec→plan engine (the /spec-to-plan skill).

Usage:
  spec-to-plan.sh <move> [args...]   forward a `devague plan` move
  spec-to-plan.sh status [--plan S]  where the plan stands + the next move
  spec-to-plan.sh help               this help

Moves (forwarded to `devague plan`; run `devague plan learn` for the method):
  new          start a plan from a CONVERGED frame (--frame <slug>)
  task         add a task (--accept / --dep / --covers, --origin user|llm)
  accept       add an acceptance criterion to a task
  depend       record that a task depends on another (--on)
  cover        mark a task as covering a coverage target (c*/h*)
  confirm      confirm a task                          (USER-only decision)
  reject       reject a task
  risk         record a first-class plan risk
  converge     check whether the plan can export
  export       write the buildable plan (only after converge passes)
  waves        emit deterministic dependency waves (scheduling metadata, not orchestration)
  status       where the plan stands + the recommended next move
  show / list  render a plan / list plans
  learn        teach the method   |   explain <move>  explain one move

Plans persist under .devague/ in the current directory — run from the repo you
are speccing. Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr; pass --json to any
move for structured output.

Note: every move — including `status` — is forwarded verbatim as `devague plan
<move>`, so new plan moves work without editing this script. (`status` was
internalised into the CLI in devague 0.11.0; it is no longer wrapper-only.)

Prior leg: a plan is seeded from a converged frame produced by the /think skill.
