# entry-point script); when the real implementation lands here, it must
# satisfy the contract documented in ../SKILL.md.

# Exits 2 (EXIT_USER_ERROR-ish for "you asked for something that isn't

# (would be 0) and "stub".

doc-test-alignment: not yet implemented.

This skill is a stub; the contract for what `check.sh` will assert lives in
.claude/skills/doc-test-alignment/SKILL.md. Until the implementation lands,
treat any green exit code from this script as a bug.

Roadmap: see CLAUDE.md ("Roadmap (CLI surface)") and docs/sibling-pattern.md.
